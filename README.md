# Arduino-Projects-from-IEEE-Nano-Workshop

**Project 1 (Potentiometer Blink):**  
 -> Create a blinking LED with its blinking rate controlled by a potentiometer. 
 
 -> Print the value being read from the potentiometer to your Serial monitor
 
**Project 2 (Digital vs. Analog, and PWM):**  
      
      **Part 1 - Sound**
          -> Write a song (minimum 10 notes) using play( ) and play it through your speaker.
          -> Get creative!
          -> Example song here: Despacito
               =>Copy-paste into your code and call Despacito() in loop() to use!
          -> No experience with music? No problem. Here are some songs with labelled notes.
     
       **Part 2 - Interface**
          -> Implement the potentiometer interface.
          -> Depending on where the dial is turned, a different song will play when you press RESET.

          -> Be able to switch between at least 3 songs.
               => This means you will have to add more music!
          -> You will need to use several if statements.
 **Project 3 - (Distance Sensor):**  
       -> Using the Arduino, LEDs, IR Emitters, and IR phototransistors, make a Distance Sensor!
               => The closer an object is to the sensor, the brighter the LED should be
               => We can control LED brightness with PWM (Pulse width modulation: Let you change the duty cycle and gives you an average voltage between 0 to 5V)
          
     
       **Part 2 - Interface**
          -> Implement the potentiometer interface.
          -> Depending on where the dial is turned, a different song will play when you press RESET.

          -> Be able to switch between at least 3 songs.
               => This means you will have to add more music!
          -> You will need to use several if statements.

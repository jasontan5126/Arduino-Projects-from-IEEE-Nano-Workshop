**Project 1 (Potentiometer Blink):**  
 -> Create a blinking LED with its blinking rate controlled by a potentiometer. 
 
 -> Print the value being read from the potentiometer to your Serial monitor
 
**Project 2 (Digital vs. Analog, and PWM):**  
       **Part 1 - Sound**
          -> Write a song (minimum 10 notes) using play( ) and play it through your speaker.
          -> Get creative!
          -> Example song here: Despacito
               =>Copy-paste into your code and call Despacito() in loop() to use!
